# DigitalThinkersAssignment

This project is an NX based monorepo. It contains 2 applications in the `packages` folder:

- `dt-api`: Express based backend API
- `dt-webapp`: React web-application

The project contains 2 other packages (`dt-api-e2e`, `dt-webapp-e2e`). I did not have time to develop these, they were generated by NX.

## How to start the application(s)?

- First, we have to install teh dependencies. This project uses PNPM: `pnpm install`
- Then, we can start the backend API: `npx nx run dt-api:serve` (if you have the NX CLI installed, then you don't need `npx`)
- Finally we can start the React web-application: `npx nx run dt-webapp:serve`

(You can use the NX Console VSCode extension, if you don't want to use the terminal)

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
