# DigitalThinkersAssignment

This project is an NX based monorepo. It contains 2 applications in the `packages` folder:

- `dt-api`: Express based backend API
- `dt-webapp`: React web-application

The project contains 2 other packages (`dt-api-e2e`, `dt-webapp-e2e`). I did not have time to develop these, they were generated by NX.

## How to start the application(s)?

- First, we have to install teh dependencies. This project uses PNPM: `pnpm install`
- Then, we can start the backend API: `npx nx run dt-api:serve` (if you have the NX CLI installed, then you don't need `npx`)
- Finally we can start the React web-application: `npx nx run dt-webapp:serve`

(You can use the NX Console VSCode extension, if you don't want to use the terminal)

## Potential improvements:

- Removing the images from the assets folder and using a CMS system / S3 bucket
- Implementing an error boundary, so it's not necessary for every endpoint to handle errors individually
- Removing unnecessary dependencies (ex.: tailwind)
- Sharing the `Driver` model between the API and the frontend via a shared package
